# Reliable UDP Transmission Protocol

## Project Overview

This initiative presents a comprehensive solution for achieving reliable data transmission over the inherently unreliable UDP protocol. By emulating critical aspects of TCP's reliability, such as acknowledgments (ACKs) for packet delivery confirmation, retransmissions upon timeouts, and strategic handling of packets received out of order, this project ensures robust data integrity and sequence maintenance over UDP. The system is split into two primary components: `3700send` for dispatching data and `3700recv` for receiving and processing data, bolstered by a checksum mechanism to verify data integrity.

## Strategic Approach

- **Robust Checksum Implementation:** To guarantee data integrity, each packet incorporates a checksum. The system discards packets failing checksum verification to prevent data corruption.
- **Adaptive Window Adjustment:** Utilizing network condition feedback, the sender dynamically modifies its window size. This adjustment strategy enhances throughput while mitigating congestion and ensuring consistent reliability.
- **Efficient Management of Out-of-Order Packets:** The receiver intelligently buffers packets arriving out of sequence, sequentially delivering them to the application layer upon completing the sequence.
- **Smart Retransmission Strategy:** To combat packet loss, the sender retransmits packets if their acknowledgments are overdue, based on a calculated timeout.

## Challenges Overcome

- **Accurate Checksum Calculation:** Developing a reliable checksum calculation and validation mechanism was essential for identifying corrupted packets without false positives or negatives.
- **Optimal Window Size Determination:** Fine-tuning the window size adjustment algorithm was crucial to achieving maximum throughput without triggering network congestion or data flow interruptions.
- **Handling Packets Out of Sequence:** Designing an effective system to manage and reorder out-of-sequence packets presented significant challenges, requiring a balance between immediate processing and minimal buffering.

## Notable Features and Innovations

- **Throughput Efficiency:** The protocol minimizes unnecessary transmissions through precise timeout recalibrations and the use of selective acknowledgments, optimizing data flow.
- **Adaptive Performance:** The protocol's ability to adjust window sizes dynamically allows it to perform well across various network conditions, making it versatile and scalable.
- **Uncompromised Reliability:** Through meticulous error checking, including the use of checksums and acknowledgment mechanisms, the protocol achieves unparalleled data integrity and transmission reliability over UDP.

## Comprehensive Testing Methodology

- **Focused Unit Tests:** Each core component, such as the checksum function and window adjustment algorithm, underwent rigorous individual testing to verify its operational integrity.
- **Integrated System Tests:** The sender and receiver were tested in tandem under simulated network conditions, including induced packet loss, latency variations, and packet reordering, to ensure system-wide reliability and efficiency.
- **Extensive Stress Testing:** The system was subjected to high traffic loads to assess its resilience, scalability, and performance in demanding environments, closely mimicking real-world network scenarios.

## Conclusion

The Reliable UDP Transmission Protocol project successfully demonstrates the feasibility of layering a robust, reliable transmission system atop UDP. It elegantly combines TCP's reliability mechanisms with UDP's simplicity and efficiency, presenting a versatile solution adaptable to a wide array of network conditions and usage scenarios. This project underscores the potential for innovative protocol design to significantly enhance data transmission reliability and efficiency.
